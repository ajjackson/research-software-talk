* COMMENT Software protips
  - Brainstorming for WMD group presentation

  - Zen of Python has lots of good stuff in. Could use as a framing
    device or as a closing summary.

  - Classify types of research software that have different needs,
    and may overlap.

    - Small program
      - e.g. /get-primitive/
      - Often called a "script" but doesn't have to be a scripting language
      - Does one job well
      - May even be a "single-shot" analysis with no options       
      - Requires
        - Comments to aid understanding and reproducibility
        - Help command and/or README
      - Nice-to-have
        - Testing with sample data
    - Library
      - e.g. /SMACT/
      - To be re-used and called from other programs via _API_
      - To be maintained and developed
      - Requires
        - API documentation. (In Python, use Sphinx and docstrings.)
        - Installation notes
        - Test suite. Libs functions get called with different kinds
          of data and from different states; lots more scope for
          breakage if these cases are not defined and tested.
      - Nice-to-have
        - Usage guide; introduction to package and usage
          examples. It's hard to interpret API docs without this!
        - Standardised coding style (good for contributions)
        - CLI scripts provide an interface for non-developers and
          useful examples for would-be API users.
    - "Code" (large program)
      - e.g. /VASP/
      - Multi-functional package for some general problem type
      - Not expected to be self-explanatory as a small program
      - Contains many components which are re-used for different
        problems
      - Usage is primarily through a CLI or GUI
      - Requires
        - API for efficiently adding/extending features
        - API documentation for developers
        - User interface (CLI and/or GUI)
        - CLI documentation for general users
          - Should include a tutorial element or there's no real way
            to get started
        - "Regression tests" can spot breakage in
          seemingly-unrelated features when changes are made
          - should be a mixture of unit tests and integration tests

      - Nice-to-have
        - Sample data

    - In practice, my workflow is usually
      1. Script prototype
      2. Convert script to a library for easier integration with other scripts
      3. Add features and variations using the API to make new CL tools


* COMMENT Details
  - Would be nice to include that classic "pro tip" picture


  - Lots of advice and commentaries on good/sustainable practice for
    research software from SSI.


  - "The FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship"
    - Comment piece in Scientific Data (Nature)
    - Findable
      - Use persistent identifier
      - Use metadata
    - Accessible
      - Retrievable by an open standard protocal
    - Interoperable
      - Format data in a formal, accessible way
    - Reusable
      - "richly described" and using community standards
      - Usage license and detailed provenance   

  - Many FAIR principles map to Software pretty well
    - Use a public source code repository following community
      standards
      - "Available by request" doesn't count
      - Also use a persistent archive such as Zotero or institutional
        repository
    - Prefer standard data file formats (txt, csv, xml, hdf5) to
      custom binary formats
    - Use a standard license and provide some documentation

  - Software has some other concerns which are not directly addressed
    by FAIR

    - Installation can be complex
    - Hardware requirements/compatibility issues
    - Managing versions


  - Why share research software?
    - Reproducibility of the research analysis. Make it easier to
      a) try the same analysis on different data sets
      b) try slightly different analysis on same data set

      - In the medium term we can expect to see increasing pressure
        from research councils to meaningfully share data and
        facilitate reproducibility

      - In the long term this is important for maintaining public
        trust in scienceg

    - Get external input.
      - External users will find bugs in your code
        - Sometimes they will fix them for you!

    - Gain influence
      - Adding your preferred methods to a package used by other
        people is one way of encouraging the community to use that
        method.

      - Adding a big warning sign to a method is one way of sharing
        your reservations about a technique...

        - Vasp does this really badly, frequently flashing "VERY BAD
          NEWS" warnings for stuff that is absolutely fine.

    - Make it portable
      - Avoids arguments about who owns the code when you change
        institution!


* COMMENT Outline

** Intro
   - "Pro tips"
   - Who am I
   - SSI

** Sustainable Research Software

*** What makes research software (un)sustainable?
**** FAIR principles

**** Application to software

*** Why bother?

*** Key points
    - PROTIP: To make software available, put it somewhere people can get it
    - PROTIP: To make software interoperable, make it work like other software
    - PROTIP: To make software reusable, allow people to reuse it


** Types of research software
   - Different interfaces, docs, testing

** Documentation
   - Defer to the Django talk, but give overview

** Packaging
   - README, CITATION.cff, LICENSE, installation procedure (INSTALL file?)

** The actual programming
   - A lot of this is just practice
   - As with an instrument, practice only helps if it's /good/
     practice
   - Programming is better with friends! It can be easier to spot an
     elegant way of doing something in someone else's code
     - e.g. Class variable for vasp syntax suggested on my pull request
   - Watch the issue tracker of a project you care about (e.g. ASE);
     this is a great way to learn from other people and get your feet
     wet with small contributions.
   - Always code with the expectation that someone else will see and
     tinker with your code. This "someone else" is probably you in a
     year's time.
   - Use a style guide e.g. PEP8
   - Introduce tests as soon as a package becomes non-trivial
   - Premature optimisation is evil
   - Slow code is also evil

* Sustainable Research Software

** Software sustainability
  
  - 92% of academics use research software
  - 69% say that their research would not be practical without it
  - 56% develop their own software 
    - (worryingly, 21% of those have no training in software development)

   - Supporting research software community in the UK
   - "Better software, better research"
   - Training (partnership with Software Carpentry)
   - Advocacy/policy (Research Software Engineers)
   - Fellowship programme (this includes me!)

** Reproducibility

   We (scientists) need to talk about reproducibility

   https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970


** Some big ideas

   People are working on ideas about relationship between code, data and science

   http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/

   https://codeisscience.github.io/manifesto/manifesto.html

*** FAIR principles
    Developed for "scientific data management" 
    https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618

    - Findable
      - Use persistent identifier
      - Use metadata
    - Available
      - Retrievable by an open standard protocal
    - Interoperable
      - Format data in a formal, accessible way
    - Reusable
      - "richly described" and using community standards
      - Usage license and detailed provenance   

*** Software trouble
    Software has some concerns aside from FAIR
    - Installation can be complex
    - Hardware requirements/compatibility issues
    - Managing versions    

** Key points
*** Availability   
    In a recent study researchers requested data and code from a
    random sample of 204 /Science/ papers...
    https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1708290115

    /Science/ has a code availability policy.

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    When you approach a PI for the source codes and raw data, you

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    I have to say that this is a very unusual request without any

   Thank you for your interest in our paper. For the [redacted]
   calculations I used my own code, and there is no public version of
   this code, which could be downloaded. Since this code is not very
   user-friendly and is under constant development I prefer not to
   share this code.
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   R is a free software package available at www.r-project.org/ I used
   R for the [redacted] models. As you probably know, [redacted] and
   [redacted] are quite complicated. But I donâ€™t have to tell you that
   given that you are a statistics student! I used Matlab for the
   geometry.

    - Use a public source code repository following community
      standards
      - Also use a persistent archive such as Zenodo or institutional
        repository

*** Interoperability
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 40%
   [[./images/protip-interoperable.png]]  
   - Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
   - You don't have to invent a new Turing-complete format for
     loosely-structured data. Use CSV,.ini,XML,JSON etc.

*** Re-usability

* Software projects

  Let's look at some different kinds of projects and consider their needs

** Small program
   - e.g. [[https://github.com/ajjackson/mctools/blob/master/mctools/get_primitive.py][get-primitive]]
   - Often called a "script" but doesn't have to be a scripting language
   - Does one job well
   - May even be a "single-shot" analysis with no options       
   - Requires
     - Comments to aid understanding and reproducibility
     - Help command and/or README
   - Nice-to-have
     - Installer
     - Testing with sample data
** Library
     - e.g. [[https://github.com/wmd-group/smact][SMACT]]
     - To be called from other programs via _API_
     - Requires
       - [[http://smact.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smact.lattice.html][API documentation]]
       - Installation notes
       - Test suite. Library gets called with different kinds
         of data and from different states; lots more scope for
         "surprises".
     - Nice-to-have
       - Usage guide; introduction to package and usage
         examples.
       - Standardised coding style (good for contributions)
       - Scripts act as an interface for non-developers and
         useful examples for API users.
** "Code" (large program)
     - e.g. /VASP/
     - Multi-functional package for some general problem type
         - Used primarily through a CLI or GUI
     - Not expected to be self-explanatory as a small program
     - Contains many components re-used for different problems
     - Requires
       - API for efficiently adding/extending features
       - Documentation for developers (API)
       - User interface (CLI and/or GUI)
       - Documentation for general users (CLI/GUI)
       - Tests
     - Nice-to-have
       - Sample data

** Workflow
    In practice, my workflow is usually

    1. Script or notebook prototype
    2. Convert script to a library for easier re-use
    3. Add features and variations using the API to make new CL tools

* Documentation

  You should watch Daniele Procida's amazing talk about documentation
  - Pycon video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azf6yzuJt54
  - Blog version https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/

  The following ideas are directly taken from it

** Four types of documentation

   - Tutorials
   - How-to guides
   - Explanation
   - Reference

** Four types of documentation
   Daniele uses a wonderful cooking analogy for these:
   - *Tutorials* "Teaching a small child to cook"
   - *How-to guides* "A recipe in a book"
   - *Explanation* "An article on culinary social history"
   - *Reference* "A reference encyclopedia article"

** Four types of documentation
   - These do not need to be located in four different places
   - They should all /exist/ and be findable at the right time

** Four types of documentation
   Applying them to scientific software:
*** Tutorials
    - Usually in a README on online manual.
    - Lead a beginner, showing input steps and expected output.

      #+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
      [[./images/galore-tut.png]]
#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>


    - Producing the right plot is a big confidence booster!
*** How-to guides
    - A concise summary of how to do useful things.
      - Questaal docs show how this can be [[https://www.questaal.org/tutorial/lmf/bandplotting/][combined with a tutorial]]
      - Visual galleries are nice: see [[http://sumo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html][sumo]] or matplotlib
*** Explanation
    - Background theory, important assumptions.
      - Could be a chapter in manual
      - Could be a "real" paper!

    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
    [[./images/phonopy-paper.png]]

*** Reference
    - API documentation
    - Detailed command line reference

* Packaging

** Stuff to include
   - README
   - LICENSE
   - CONTRIBUTING
   - INSTALL
   - CITATION
   - tests

** README
   - This document is usually your "homepage"
   - Introduce the project
   - Point to other resources

** LICENSE
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Licensing is complicated
   - Don't make it more complicated by inventing your own
   - Use of standard licenses makes it quicker and easier for users
   - https://choosealicense.com/

** CONTRIBUTING
   - Are external contributions welcome?
   - How should people interact with the project?
   - Do you have style/format requirements?

** INSTALL
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Try to make installation easy...
   - ... but don't be /weird/ about it!
   - =sudo= makes me nervous
   - For Python projects, use setuptools
   - For compiled languages, use a simple makefile or autoconf

** CITATION
   - This is cutting edge!
   - There still isn't really a standard way to cite code...
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
   - ... but there should be!
   - [[https://citation-file-format.github.io/][Citation file format]] has been proposed. 
     - Based on YAML: readability balanced for humans and machines
     - Can include papers
   - [[https://software.ac.uk/index.php/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software][New journals are emerging]]

** tests
   - Don't re-invent the wheel, use an existing framework for
     non-trivial testing
   - "Continuous Integration" e.g. Travis CI automatically runs tests when changes are pushed to repository
   - Coverage testing is depressing but helpful

     #+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
     [[./images/badges.png]]

* The actual coding bit

** Some key skills
   - Version control
     - Learn how to use feature branches
     - Write helpful commit messages

   - Get good at editing
     - Be lazy
     - Use macros
     - Use plugins

** How to get better at programming
   - A lot of this is just practice
   - As with an instrument, practice only helps if it's /good/
     practice
   - Try different things:
     - Test-driven development
     - Use more objects
     - Use less objects

** How to get better at programming
   - Programming is better with friends! It can be easier to spot an
     elegant way of doing something in someone else's code
   - Watch the issue tracker of a project you care about (e.g. ASE);
     this is a great way to learn from other people and get your feet
     wet with small contributions.

** PROTIP: Write good code
   - Always code with the expectation that someone else will see and
     tinker with your code. This "someone else" is probably you in a
     year's time.
   - Use a style guide e.g. PEP8

** PROTIP: Write good code
   - Plan out your overall structure and think about data types
   - Introduce tests as soon as a package becomes non-trivial
   - Premature optimisation is evil
   - Slow code is also evil

** PROTIP: Write good code
   - Don't let perfect get in the way of good

* Summary

** Summary
   - Good science is open about its methods
     - They probably involve software
   - You're going to have to show people your software
   - Good code doesn't make good software; good practice makes good software
   - There is an overwhelming number of tools and options
   - but also many good projects you can imitate
